This project was conceived as a learning exercise. I discovered midway through the process that Craigslist disapproves of web scrapers, making it challenging to extract clean data from its website. After some tinkering and trial and error, I managed to extract data that could be considered useful for the purpose of my exercise.

The data set contains:
Post URL
Post title
Post price
Post location

The project was developed in Python and utilizes the following libraries/frameworks:
    Requests to handle HTTP requests.
    BeautifulSoup to extract data from HTML files.
    Pandas to manipulate the dataset and export it to a CSV file.
